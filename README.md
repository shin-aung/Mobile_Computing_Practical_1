**Learning Journey: Android Studio Basics and Unit Testing**

Embarking on Practical Exercise 1, I navigated through various tasks to grasp fundamental Android Studio usage, Java coding, and basic unit testing. Here's a summary of my experiences:

**Task 0 - Technical Icebreaker:**

Programming Languages: Proficient in Java, moderately confident. Limited experience in Python and JavaScript.
Debugging Techniques: Familiar with print debugging, breakpoints, and logging. Highly confident in using each technique.
Problem-Solving Techniques: Experienced in breaking down problems, using algorithms, and seeking help from documentation. Highly confident.
Code Readability: Highly important. Clear code enhances collaboration and maintenance, crucial in the software development lifecycle.
Data Structures and Algorithms: Experienced in arrays, linked lists, stacks, and basic algorithms. Moderately confident.
Previous Program: Developed a web-based expense tracker. Enabled users to log expenses, view summaries, and set budgets.
Subject Requirement: Required for the degree.
Learning Goals: To acquire practical Android development skills, understand app lifecycle, and improve Java proficiency.

**Task 1 - Android Studio Basics:**

Project Creation: Created a new project named "GuessingGame" using the "Empty Activity" template.
XML Editing: Adjusted activity_main.xml using the code view for a vertical LinearLayout, added Button and EditText.
Issue Resolution: Addressed touch target and autofill issues using the "issues panel."
XML Text Editing: Modified XML attributes for better UI appearance.
Emulator Testing: Successfully ran the project on the emulator.

**Task 2 - Java Coding and Unit Testing:**

Unit Testing Setup: Added a unit test method run_game() in ExampleUnitTest.
Game Class Creation: Implemented the Game class to satisfy the unit test.
Test Execution: Ran the test to verify the functionality of the Game class.

**Task 3 - Connect Game with GUI:**

XML Editing: Added onClick attribute to the Button tag in activity_main.xml.
Method Creation: Added a new method checkGuess() to MainActivity.java.
EditText Modification: Changed id, inputType, and resolved an issue in EditText.
findViewById(): Accessed the user's input using the findViewById() method.
Game Object Integration: Added a member field to MainActivity for the Game object.
Game Check Integration: Implemented game check using the checkGuess() method and displayed results using Toast.

**Task 4 - Self-Reflection:**

Description: Successfully navigated through Android Studio basics, XML editing, Java coding, and unit testing.
Feelings and Thoughts: Felt confident in existing skills, with a focus on enhancing Android development knowledge.
Evaluation: Positive experience with effective learning. Minor challenges in XML modifications.
Analysis: Recognized the importance of systematic problem-solving and clear code readability.
Conclusion: Learned essential Android development concepts. Could explore advanced features and improve algorithmic skills.
Action Plan: Focus on dynamic UI, advanced Android features, and continuous algorithmic improvement.
